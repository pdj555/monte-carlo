# Codebase Constitution

This document defines the guiding principles and standards of the `monte-carlo` repository. It provides a clear foundation for contributors and AI agents interacting with this project.

## 1. Purpose

- Maintain a clean, organized, and future‑focused codebase for Monte Carlo simulations.
- Embrace simplicity and clarity in all code and documentation.
- Serve as the primary reference for decision making within the project.

## 2. Source Documents

The constitution is based on the following current documentation:

- **README.md** – Overview, prerequisites, installation steps, usage instructions, function details, and license.

All future documents placed under `docs/` should extend or clarify this constitution without contradicting it.

## 3. Guiding Principles

1. **Demand Excellence** – Strive for well‑structured code and thoughtful design. Each contribution should improve maintainability and readability.
2. **Embrace Simplicity** – Implement straightforward solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over‑engineering.
3. **Future Forward** – Use modern, reliable frameworks when they enhance the project. Prefer widely adopted libraries with strong community support.
4. **Consistency** – Follow established formatting and naming conventions. Keep style cohesive across files and modules.
5. **Transparency** – Document decisions, functions, and data flows clearly. Comment code where intent or implementation is not obvious.
6. **Quality Assurance** – Test code thoroughly. Validate data inputs and outputs. Include examples and usage notes when appropriate.
7. **Open Collaboration** – Encourage constructive feedback. Respect different viewpoints while prioritizing code quality and user experience.

## 4. Conventions and Standards

- **Language**: Python 3.x.
- **Formatting**: Use spaces (4 per indentation level) and follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines.
- **Dependencies**: Manage with `pip` and list them in documentation. Keep external packages minimal and purposeful.
- **Documentation**: Markdown for all guides and references. Keep sections concise and well‑organized.
- **Version Control**: Commits should be descriptive. Group related changes into a single commit whenever reasonable.
- **Licensing**: The project uses the MIT License as noted in the README.

## 5. Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork or branch from the main repository.
2. Create pull requests with clear descriptions of changes and reasoning.
3. Ensure new code is tested and linted before submitting.
4. Update documentation when functionality or behavior changes.
5. Maintain backward compatibility unless a breaking change is discussed and agreed upon.

## 6. AI Agent Directives

AI agents interacting with this repository should:

- Adhere to this constitution and respect existing code style.
- Avoid introducing proprietary or closed‑source dependencies without consensus.
- Provide context and rationale when generating new code or documentation.
- Keep outputs focused and relevant to project goals.

## 7. Looking Ahead

This project aims to model stock price simulations using a modern yet minimalist approach. Future expansions may include additional financial models, integration tests, or visualization tools. All new features should align with the principles of simplicity, organization, and excellence outlined above.
